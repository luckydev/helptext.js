:) this was my first jQuery plugin. I was pretty excited to see this coming out. Note that you can acheive the same help text thing in HTML 5 using placeholder attribute.  

== helptext.js

helptext.js is a small jQuery plugin to label the form input elements inside their container itself. Look at http://luckydev.github.com/helptext.js for example. It can eliminate using labels in the forms.


=== How to use

helptext.js requires jQuery. It has been tested in jQuery 1.5.1. I'm sure it will work in almost all the versions. Also download and include helptext.js like below.

  <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery-1.5.1.min.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="helptext.js"></script>

In the elements where you need help text, add an attribute `data-helptext` like:

  <input type="text" name="login" data-helptext="Your login name" />

Then call helptext() like:

  $(document).ready(function(){
    $("input[type=text], input[type=password], textarea").helptext();
  }) 

Use any selector for choosing the form elements. The above code is just an example.

=== Usage in Rails form helpers

  <%= f.text_field :name, :"data-helptext" => "Give your name" %>
